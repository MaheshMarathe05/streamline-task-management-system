# Backup Code Exhaustion - Comprehensive Solution

## Problem Statement
**Critical Security Issue**: Users who exhaust all 8 backup codes and forget to generate new ones before logging out become completely locked out of their accounts, with no way to regain access through the normal authentication flow.

## Solution Overview
Implemented a multi-layered account recovery system that provides secure access restoration while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards.

## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. **Detection & Prevention**
- **Low Backup Codes Warning**: Users receive alerts when they have ‚â§2 codes remaining
- **Real-time Tracking**: System tracks code usage and displays remaining count
- **Dashboard Notifications**: Persistent warnings on dashboard when codes are low
- **Login Warnings**: Immediate alerts during login if backup codes are running low

### 2. **Account Recovery System**
When all backup codes are exhausted, users have multiple recovery options:

#### **Option A: Email-Based Recovery**
- Users can request account recovery via email
- System generates secure recovery tokens (32-byte crypto-random)
- Recovery links expire after 24 hours
- Full audit trail of all recovery attempts

#### **Option B: Emergency Access**
- Provides temporary 30-minute access to account
- Limited functionality - forces backup code regeneration
- Shorter token expiry for enhanced security
- Clear visual warnings throughout emergency session

### 3. **Security Enhancements**

#### **Backend Security**
```javascript
// Enhanced backup code verification with exhaustion detection
const availableCodes = user.twoFactor.backupCodes.filter(code => !code.isUsed);
if (availableCodes.length === 0) {
  return res.status(400).json({ 
    success: false, 
    error: 'All backup codes have been used. Please use account recovery.', 
    requiresRecovery: true,
    allCodesExhausted: true
  });
}
```

#### **Recovery Token Generation**
```javascript
// Cryptographically secure recovery tokens
const recoveryToken = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
```

#### **Activity Logging**
- All recovery requests logged with IP, user agent, timestamp
- Security events tracked: `account_recovery_requested`, `emergency_access_granted`
- Complete audit trail for compliance

### 4. **User Experience Flow**

#### **Normal Login Flow** (When codes available)
1. User enters password ‚úÖ
2. User enters backup code ‚úÖ
3. System warns if codes are low (‚â§2 remaining)
4. User redirected to dashboard with persistent warning

#### **Exhausted Codes Flow**
1. User enters password ‚úÖ
2. System detects no available backup codes ‚ùå
3. User sees error with "Use Account Recovery" button
4. Recovery options presented:
   - **Generate New Codes**: Full recovery with new 8 codes
   - **Emergency Access**: 30-minute temporary access

#### **Recovery Success Flow**
1. User receives recovery email (or uses emergency access)
2. Clicks recovery link or uses token
3. System generates 8 new backup codes
4. Old codes automatically invalidated
5. Codes displayed and auto-downloaded
6. User can login normally with new codes

### 5. **Frontend Components**

#### **Account Recovery Page** (`/recovery`)
- **Request Recovery**: Email-based recovery initiation
- **Verify Recovery**: Token verification and code generation
- **Emergency Access**: Temporary account access
- **Professional UI**: Matches existing design system

#### **Enhanced Login Page**
- Detects backup code exhaustion
- Provides direct recovery link
- Shows appropriate error messages
- Maintains security context

#### **Settings Page Enhancements**
- Emergency access warnings
- Grace period notifications
- Auto-focus on security section from recovery flow
- Visual indicators for account status

#### **Dashboard Notifications**
- Persistent warnings for low backup codes
- One-click navigation to settings
- Dismissible notifications
- Clean, professional styling

### 6. **Security Middleware**

#### **Emergency Access Protection**
```javascript
export const requireBackupCodes = (req, res, next) => {
  // Block emergency users from critical operations
  if (req.user && req.user.emergencyAccess && req.user.mustRegenerateBackupCodes) {
    return res.status(403).json({ 
      success: false, 
      error: 'You must regenerate backup codes before accessing this feature',
      requiresBackupCodeRegeneration: true,
      emergencyAccess: true
    });
  }
  next();
};
```

### 7. **Database Models**

#### **AccountRecovery Model**
```javascript
{
  userId: ObjectId,
  email: String,
  recoveryToken: String,
  recoveryType: ['backup_codes_exhausted', 'forgot_password', 'account_lockout'],
  isUsed: Boolean,
  expiresAt: Date, // 24 hours
  metadata: {
    ip: String,
    userAgent: String,
    reason: String
  }
}
```

#### **Enhanced SecurityLog**
- Tracks all recovery events
- Comprehensive audit trail
- IP and user agent logging
- Event categorization

### 8. **API Endpoints**

#### **Recovery Routes** (`/api/recovery`)
- `POST /request-recovery` - Initiate account recovery
- `POST /verify-recovery` - Complete recovery with new codes
- `POST /emergency-login` - Get temporary emergency access

#### **Enhanced Auth Routes**
- Updated login verification to detect code exhaustion
- Warning responses for low backup codes
- Recovery requirement flags

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### **Protection Against Abuse**
1. **Rate Limiting**: Recovery requests limited per IP/email
2. **Token Expiry**: 24-hour expiration for recovery tokens
3. **Single Use**: Recovery tokens invalidated after use
4. **Activity Logging**: Complete audit trail
5. **Emergency Time Limits**: 30-minute emergency access only

### **Data Protection**
1. **Secure Token Generation**: Crypto-random 32-byte tokens
2. **No Token Storage**: Tokens hashed before storage
3. **Auto-Cleanup**: Expired tokens automatically removed
4. **Backup Code Invalidation**: Old codes immediately invalidated

### **Access Control**
1. **Limited Emergency Access**: Critical operations blocked
2. **Visual Warnings**: Clear indication of account status
3. **Forced Regeneration**: Must generate codes to restore full access
4. **Session Management**: Emergency sessions tracked separately

## üìä User Education

### **Proactive Warnings**

- Admin intervention procedures documented
- Security team contact information provided

### **What if emergency access expires?**
- Full recovery process must be repeated
- New recovery tokens generated
- Additional verification may be required

### **What if user loses recovery token?**
