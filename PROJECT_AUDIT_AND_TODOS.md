## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **ACCESS CONTROL GAPS**

#### ❌ **Issue 1.1: Task Deletion Logic**
- **Current:** Managers can ONLY delete "To Do" tasks
- **Problem:** This is illogical - managers should be able to delete any task
- **Location:** `TasksPage.jsx` line 191-200
```jsx
{isManager && status === 'To Do' && (
    <button onClick={() => handleDeleteTask(task._id)}>
        <Trash2 size={16} />
    </button>
)}
```
- **Backend:** `server/routes/tasks.js` correctly allows manager to delete any task
- **Fix Needed:** Remove status restriction in frontend

#### ❌ **Issue 1.2: Employee Task Creation**
- **Current:** Only managers can create tasks
- **Problem:** Employees should be able to create tasks for themselves or request task creation
- **Location:** `TasksPage.jsx` line 179
- **Fix Needed:** Add employee task creation/request flow

#### ❌ **Issue 1.3: Employee Cannot Edit Task Details**
- **Current:** Employees can only update status and submit reports
- **Problem:** Employees should be able to edit task descriptions, estimated hours, etc.
- **Fix Needed:** Add task edit modal for employees

#### ❌ **Issue 1.4: No Task Assignment Change Request**
- **Current:** Only managers can reassign tasks
- **Problem:** Employees cannot request task reassignment
- **Fix Needed:** Add reassignment request workflow

---

### 2. **MISSING VERIFICATION/APPROVAL WORKFLOWS**

#### ❌ **Issue 2.1: No Manager Verification for Status Changes**
- **Current:** Employees directly change task status
- **Problem:** No manager approval required for status changes (especially "Done")
- **Fix Needed:** Add status change request + manager approval flow

#### ❌ **Issue 2.2: Report Submission Has No Follow-up**
- **Current:** Employees submit reports but there's no review/approval system
- **Problem:** Reports are submitted but not tracked or approved
- **Fix Needed:** Add report review and approval workflow

#### ❌ **Issue 2.3: No Project Status Change Approval**
- **Current:** Project status can be changed without verification
- **Fix Needed:** Add project status change approval for critical changes

---

### 3. **MISSING CRUD OPERATIONS**

#### ❌ **Issue 3.1: Tasks**
- ✅ Create (Manager only)
- ✅ Read (Both)
- ⚠️ Update (Limited - status only for employees)
- ⚠️ Delete (Manager only, but restricted to "To Do")

#### ❌ **Issue 3.2: Projects**
- ✅ Create (Manager only) - **Correct**
- ✅ Read (Both)
- ✅ Update (Manager only) - **Correct**
- ✅ Delete (Manager only) - **Correct**

#### ❌ **Issue 3.3: Team Management**
- ✅ Create (Manager only) - **Correct**
- ✅ Read (Manager only) - **Should employees see team list?**
- ✅ Update (Manager only) - **Correct**
- ✅ Delete (Manager only) - **Correct**
