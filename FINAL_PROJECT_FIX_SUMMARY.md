# ✅ Final Project Fix - October 4, 2025 (19:42)

## Issue Identified
Projects were showing incorrect data - all projects displayed Mobile App Development information regardless of which project card was clicked.

## Root Cause
The task data mapping in `ProjectDetailPage.jsx` was using incorrect project IDs that didn't match the actual MongoDB database IDs.

---
